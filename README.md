Vehicle Rental System

Overview
This Java application simulates a vehicle rental system using OOP principles. 
It includes a base class Vehicle and three child classes: Car, Motorcycle, and CargoVan. 
There are also interfaces following that order.
The main class handles the input-output using try-catch blocks for error handling.


Methods:
Constructor and getters/setters for properties.
Calculations for each type of vehicle with constants for the prices for easier changes in the future.
toString method in the parent class for repeatable fields.
ValidationHelper class with methods used for validation of inputs.

Main Method:
Creates instances of Car, Motorcycle, and CargoVan.
Demonstrates polymorphism and inheritance.
Handles user input and outputs rental details.
Utilizes try-catch blocks for error handling (e.g., invalid input).

Error Handling
Utilizes try-catch blocks to catch exceptions 
and provide meaningful error messages (e.g., invalid input, calculation errors).

Usage
Run the Application: Execute the main class to start the vehicle rental system.
Output: View rental details and costs based on the selected vehicles.
